I am starting my project and am having trouble with the project solution in visual studio. I successfully started and can open a window when the game is run but cannot connect my data files. When I try and load in my font the build succeeds but errors come up because it cannot findthe font.

Okay I think my problem with creating a solution was because I imported instead of creating a new project which messed everything up. I just deleted my files and started new but now I'm not sure how I will push to git because it is in its own folder outside of the final project folder. BUT on the brightside my font is found and everything is working.

Very exciting! Start window all set up with music loop. Set up pressed key to start. Was having trouble with loading music but put it directly into the file in file explorer instead of in visual studio and it fixed the problem.

Okay I have found cropped all the picture options for the face options. Hoping to explore a few of the libraries I mentioned in my proposal to load images in.
