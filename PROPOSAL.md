# Project Proposal

**Picture Perfect**

For my final project I am going to mimic a classic Mario Party 3 mini-game.

This game is always very fun and is completely dependent on user interaction so I thought it would be perfect for openFramework and this assignment as a whole.

**Description**

In my game there will be a four different visuals for each aspect of the 2-D animated face. There will be noses, hair, eyes, and smiles. At the beginning of the game a random combination of the three components will be generated and presented to the game-player. The game will then begin. The game will start with displaying each hair type for a small amount of time, and will rotate between the three options. The player will use the H key to stop on the desired hair, with the purpose being to match the hair of the original generated face. This process will then repeat with the nose (the N key pausing for the nose), then with the mouth (M key), finally the eyes(E key). If the face the player creates is the same as the generated image, a graphic celebrating their win will dislay, otherwise a "You Lose" will display.
I am excited to create these graphics in a Paint application and then load them into mmy project.
